# Zemoga UI-test

- This test was done mostly using **Angular** and **SASS** for styling.
- The data is stored in local storage, saving a JSON with an array keeping elements storing each individual item's votes and info like name or description.
- Most of the work was accomplished by making use of angular directives (ngIf, ngStyle, ngClass, ngFor, etc...)
- Also made use of pipes to format percentage bar's decimals and to display how much time ago a voting was submitted using dates.
- Media queries were used to style the project for mobile/tablet
